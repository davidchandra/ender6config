# Creality Ender 6 configuration.h and configuration_adv.h
This is my attempt in creating the configuration files for the Ender 6. Please note that this is experimental and use at your own risk.

I have modified my stock hardware that is reflected in the my experimentation.  Specifically these are the hardware targeted by this configuration:

- Bondtech DDX extruder for Creality
- Moquito Magnum hot end
- Slice engineering heating element (24v, 50W)
- BLTouch 3.1 for auto be levelling

I will be also be looking to use a custom thermistor that can go up to 450 / 500 degrees.
